# ArrayOfStudentFaculty

This project inputs a Colleges student and faculty data into a java array. Student and faculty are implemented as classes and are comparable. Furthermore, I made the College, Student and faculty class serializable to input this data into a file. The College class is then loaded to a file via Java's Object IO stream. Finally, I loaded the data from the file into another College class and compared the 2 classes which should be the same.
